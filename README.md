### FAQ

**How can I get started with a Hugo template?**

For inspiration, check out the guide for the [Researcher](./templates/researcher/README.md) template. Similar steps can also be applied to the other templates.

**What version of Hugo Extended does a template support?**

The supported version of Hugo can be found under `HUGO_VERSION` in a template's `netlify.toml` file.

**How can I install Hugo Extended?**

The [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) website details how to install Hugo Extended. We have also put together a simpler [Hugo installation guide](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/install-hugo-extended/).

However, **most users find it easier _not_ to install Hugo**. Users recommend just editing a template's Markdown files in a Markdown editor (e.g. Typora or VSCode), uploading the files to GitHub, and using Netlify to automatically run Hugo, deploying the site.
